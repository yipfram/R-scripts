# R-scripts

This is the "Data analysis" course github.

# Architechture

Here you can find the scripts created during the course. (I started this repo on the 5th week, feel free to make a pull request to add the courses scripts that are missing ;) )

Each folder has a "homework.R" script and a Rscript.r script. Rscript is the script created during the course. The other is the homework due for the week.

# Enjoy ;)
